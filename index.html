    <p>Fire Island National Seashore is a beautiful escape from the city. During my trip, I explored pristine beaches, walked along scenic trails, and enjoyed breathtaking sunsets over the ocean. The park offers a peaceful retreat and plenty of opportunities for wildlife spotting, kayaking, and relaxing by the water.</p>

    <p>Visiting Fire Island was an unforgettable experience — a perfect mix of adventure and tranquility!</p>
